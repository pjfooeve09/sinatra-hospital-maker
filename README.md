Welcome to Sinatra Hospital Maker!

This is a MVC Sinatra application that allows users to create an account and login to their account. Once logged in, the user can create a hospital based on hospital's name and hospital's country, and can also view a list of all the hospitals created. The models included are: a user has many hospitals and a hospital belongs to a user.
Once a hospital is added, it can only be edited and deleted by the user who originally added the hospital.
